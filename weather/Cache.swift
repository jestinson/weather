/**
    Container that holds a collection of generic values referenced by string keys. Data is held in
    memory and the size of the collection is bounded. The API is similar to a native Dictionary.

    Internally when an item is added an NSDate is stored for record keeping. When the cache reaches
    the maximum size the oldest item is removed. When an item is accessed its corresponding date is
    bumped to the current time to keep the item from being removed next time the maximum is reached.
    This means that items added and never accessed with be removed before items frequently accessed
    even if they are the oldest.

    This class is implemented using a standard Dictionary which provides best case O(1) and worst
    case O(n) access times. Since a cache accesses always require two traversals of the data
    structure (one to get the item, and a second to update the item with a new date) the expected
    performance is 2 * O(1) to 2 * O(n) or simply O(1) to O(n). Cache insertions become 2 * O(1)
    to 2 * O(n^2) or O(1) to O(n^2).
